## ðŸ”§ Models Compared
| Model Code | Model                 | RÂ² Score | RMSE     |
|------------|-----------------------|----------|----------|

## ðŸ§  Insights
- Removing `target_productivity` reduces RÂ² for all models.
- Random Forest still performed best, indicating its ability to generalize and capture patterns from other features.
- Features such as `smv`, `wip`, `no_of_workers`, and `over_time` contribute meaningfully to predictions.

---

## âœ… Conclusion
Even without access to targets, ML models can still provide useful productivity estimates. Random Forest is a strong choice for deployment in planning tools to improve efficiency and reduce reliance on over-time.

## ðŸ’¾ Next Steps
- Hyperparameter tuning (especially for XGBoost)
- Aggregate features by date/team for group-level forecasting
- Deploy model using Streamlit for planners to use easily
